# Advent of Code 2021

My goal was to write code as Pythonic as possible, which often means ugly (so long as it's for the sake of conciseness).

Hard to read, hard to understand, but very fun to code! If my work can be described by the 
words "bails mystiques", then the day was a success.

Contains oversights and possible improvements here and there since I tried not to go back to challenges after I finished them
